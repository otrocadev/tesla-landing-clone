# 🚗 Tesla Landing Page Clone using 🚀 Astro & 🔥 Tailwind CSS

This project tries to replicate the landing page of the [Tesla's](tesla.com/es_ES) webpage in Spain to learn Astro and CSS technologies.

## Why Astro and Tailwind CSS?

The goal of the project was to make the front of the landing page as efficient as possible, so as the page is mainly static, **Astro** with **Tailwind CSS** is a great combo to build fast.

## Interesting features developed

⚙️ **Reusable Components:** Using the capacity of **componentization** that **Astro** offers, A main slide named **_Section_** is the base component that shows the content of every card (Vehicles and derived products).

🌟 **Snap-to-Center**: A nice adaptation is the feature implemented to snap the viewport to the center of the page for the model/product of interest, enhancing user experience and engagement, as the product page has the full height, but on the original site this behavior does not work.
